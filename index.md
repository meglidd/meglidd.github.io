## About My Project

**Visualizing the Distribution of the Neutral Position**

To first learn how to work with OpenPose and its data output, I will apply OpenPose to ASL Avatar Paula to create a motion trace on her wrist. I will do this using a heatmap approach to show what locations (in 2D) are most likely to be occupied. From here, with OpenPose data from the DGS-Korpus at the University of Hamburg, I will process + analyze the location results through graph visualizations, looking for significant distributions of the Neutral Position.
