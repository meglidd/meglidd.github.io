This week I created "download.py" to take the video number from the excel file that was parsed and insert it into an HTTP link to mass-download all of the files in question: there are about 700.

This was mildly challenging. I had an issue with "/n" being attached to the end of the .mp4 files being downloaded so the files were invalid. This was easily fixed (with insight from Rosalee!!) by putting in a filter to remove "/n" characters before downloading the file. 

Success!

Now to put these videos through OpenPose and my coding from earlier.
