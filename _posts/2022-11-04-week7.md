This week, we asked the following questions:
* what research has been dones before this that is similar to our research (current papers?) and how is it different from what we are resarching?
* what is a sentence in sign language? 

To answer the first question, there are similar papers that exist but they are different to ours in the following ways:
* they focus on pauses, not on the duration of entire time the hands were traversing during the transition
* they focus on different categories than ours. Ours categories were derived from Boston University

Our project is now using the data to pull the mean values of the time between each category bigram for each participant.

Moving forward, we will look at the data extracted from the video annotated files, of whih will only look at the top nine categories of category bigrams, as those categories had the most amount of data to be able to attempt to draw conclusions from.
