title: Week 4
---

For the fourth week of my the project, I was now aimed at running a program, specifically autotrace, with InvsCov and AFL++. 
I ran into problems with Daikon working (the daikon file was not updating with the ‘learned invariants’ command):

$ /invscov/InvsCov/learn-invariants ~/invscov/autotrace-0.31.1/fuzz/in ./autotrace_dump @@

1 error
3654 warnings
make[2]: *** [Makefile:1096: api] Error 1

This issue was fixed by:
1. Set path invscov_Cc to clang by adding the following commands to BASHRC:
    export INVSCOV_CC=/clang+llvm-10.0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-18.04/bin/clang
    export INVSCOV_CXX=/clang+llvm-10.0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-18.04/bin/clang++
