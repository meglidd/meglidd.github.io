To test the median values: wilcoxon
To test the mean values: t-test 

Wilcoxon test
- Applicable because we are using media + it is true the data is quantized because it is frames (30 frames/second). When writing paper, use A citation that justifies the use of this in this case. when it involves lexical, you have a difference. Transition from lexical, beacuse they are so used to working with lexical signs, that when you shift from there into something else there is a notable difference.
- Data is NOT parametric because the data is on key frames
- Further studies will be necessary - but we are seeing these differences. 

T-Test:
- look for examples that exemplify this asymmetric relationship and give a reason why this is happening.
- In moving from lexical to index, one does not move their hand drastically because a classifier has to be located somewhere in space
- Lexical to gesture // gesture to lexical is a huge difference
- End of lexical as picture, and end of gesture as picture, to show they are not moving far in space. 
- going into gesture is faster than coming out of gesture! Why? Could be many reasons. FIND EXAMPLES

Gestures
- Gesture is an area that has little study within context of sign language. Question could be, because it is an unknown, maybe the annotations were unclear where they started
- Show patterns, in the future should look deeper into what the statistical relationships mean and push the rest off to further work.
- Gesture is amorphous, nonlinguistic recognized. Do quick google scholar search. A lot of things that are not currently analyzable are tossed into the “basket of gesture”
- Papers written on how there is gesture in sign language, too.
- Skim through abstracts, what is a gesture in sign language?

General Notes:
- When you are setting up a classifier, you are painting a picture with your hands. Maybe there is more precision that may occur and also signaling “I am about to sign a pic”. 
- Lexical to lexical: all sign with same relative transition speed. Why? Since we are talking about median, and bc there are so many lexical to lexical, they become the median
- Lexical to lexical is most common transition
- Data is telling us that majority are lexical items
- There were X # lexical, Y # gestures (frequency count)
- Transitions btw different signs, if most are from one lexical to the next, next step would be to focus on lexical only. 
- Gestures are more common than classifier (are gestures a catch-all?). maybe using non-standard classifiers. 

TO DO:
When going through videos, for going into index: 
- pause that happens when pointing. (Index)
- Is that median because we established the index and the reference is fast?
