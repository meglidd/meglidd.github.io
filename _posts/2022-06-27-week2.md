title: Week 2
---

For the second week of my the project, I attempted to compile and install AFL++:
- issues downloading AFL++ 
  - Make distrib / make: Issues finding clang/llvm
  - Troubleshooting: Not much online for this specific problem. Some sources told me to try the following commands, but they were not successful:
    - make && make -C llvm_mode LLVM_CONFIG=llvm-config-6.0 CC=clang-6.0
    - make && make -C llvm_mode CXX=g++
    - git checkout dev
    - make source-only install
- Tried reinstalling LLVM/Clang 
- Found 1 alternative source for installing AFL++ to a MAC OS: also unsuccessful 

All were unsuccessful and it wasn't until meeting with Professor Huang and we were able to work through these issues together. 

This week I also met with my research mentor group, led by Professor Gabe Fierro at the Colorado School of Mines.
