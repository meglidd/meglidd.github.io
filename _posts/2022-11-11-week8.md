title: Week 8
---
This week, we noted the following:
* Transitions take longer bc persons arenâ€™t as used to doing them. Muscle memory?
* LSF + ASL are comparable (ASL is daughter language of LSF)
* Literature on hypothesis that classifier structures are among most universal across signers. Bc you are drawing/depicting. More common that lexical.
* what is the number of appearances: between ben and Michael, do a percentage count to see if they are comparable (in terms of their usage)
* Who has signed? Norma or ben? Need to see who did each/count 

in regards to the category bigram data:
* STRANGE: Gesture to lexical is different than lexical to gesture
* NORMALIZE: Overall medium transition time. For each person. Then divide by overall median 
* RUN STAT test on difference between medians (analysis of variance test) to show for ex. That lexical to gesture and gesture to lexical have a statistically different median. 
* Standard dev are wide but if you divide by overall median for each signer, will squeeze the overall ranges.


For next week:
Go through the videos to see if they were signed by Norma or Ben
