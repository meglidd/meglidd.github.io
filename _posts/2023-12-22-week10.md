This week was all about finishing the final paper! I had everything documented and well-organized so writing the paper was straightforward.

Of course, while submitting this for review, there was more to be done. I was successful in the initial aim, but the project needs to further trim all the videos so the data does not contain the rise of the hands to the start of the sign. We also want to make sure there is only one point per video, whereas now there are numerous points per video as there are as many points as frames.
