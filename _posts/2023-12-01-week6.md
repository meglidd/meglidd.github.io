The plan for the next steps:

1. Understand HamNoSys notation system, particularly the notation for location. Review: hamnosys-user-guide-rs-draft-v3-0.pdf (incomplete version) 
and the most comprehensive file: HamNoSys_06en.pdf   (locations begin on slide 26).

2. Identifying the signs beginning in neutral position -- the "neutral position" / "neutral space" is the null string! Set up a filter that examines the HamNoSys and excludes all entries that have location symbols.

3. For those entries without a HamNoSys location symbol, copy down and save the associated videos from the DGS-Korpus, per the examples given above.  Probably the front view is the one that would be most useful.  Find how to download and save mp4 files â€”google "python save mp4 from URL" 
-- not sure how to do this with the different font that HamNoSys is in. Cannot search for these symbols with Python?
   
5. Use the tools developed in the first half of the project to trace the paths of the wrists

6. Paper write-up
