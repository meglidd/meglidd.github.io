NOTES:
- Asymmetry in transition time of signing depending on the order of how things happen
- Signing STYLE = in terms of relative use of lexical and classifiers etc., can say this was an identifier bc we made the hypothesis this was ben, and when we went through this was largely ben. 
- Demographics of signer? Grow up in a deaf household? Look at distribution of number of types of signing. More Deaf you are, the more classifiers you will use. Boston University: look for info on demographics
- If the signing comes from translations in English, they will all be Lexical category signs. If it is native signing between two people, especially for a story,  there will be more classifiers that are used (lingustic processes in different languages). ex: Description + location were in classifiers
- There is a difference in overall signing speed, validated by the p-value in stat analysis

TO DO:
- STLAT conference: possiblitiy of publishing DREAM paper here
- Divide by median for standardization (Nicole doing)
- run a T-test for the MEDIAN not mean (this is because we have "noisy" data)
- Look for similarities after the normalization of medians for signing speed
