Potential visualization tools to create a heatmap of ASL avatar Paula's wrists:
- Plotly: https://plotly.com/python/Â  create visualizations
- Dash: https://dash.plotly.com/  to build dashboards in Python using Plotly figures
- Matplotlib library https://matplotlib.org/  to help use Plotly

**Where are the central/neutral spaces (based on Paula's wrist locations)?
**

From the frames of data:
- focus on the wrists
- X Y probability of the location being used (find pixel location, X will be between 0 and 1)
- Where are the wrists at each frame?
  - Possible approach:
    - Create 2d array and see at location X,Y, go to array and go to location and +1.
    - Heat map: take values and see min + max values and use white to rep MAX and MIN black.
- Eventually, create one heat map of one video.


Progress in this attempt:
- Heat maps did not work with open pose? Ran open pose again on the files, but removed the background (not sure if this is useful as I am going to be using the JSON files, not the PNGs).
- Created two CSV files with all of the points for the right + left hands of the 200 frames.

- Write a Python program to go through the CSV file to create a heat map from this.
