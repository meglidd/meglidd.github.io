title: Week 1
---

For the first week of my the project, I read through background information on data flow analysis, and also read four papers on categorizing security vulnerabilities + fuzzing. 

These papers included: 
1. [Talos: Neutralizing Vulnerabilities with Security Workarounds for Rapid Response](https://facsrv.cs.depaul.edu/zhuang28/Talos-Oakland2016.pdf)
    
_       Zhen Huang, Mariana D’Angelo, Dhaval Miyani, + David Lie
_    
2. [Rapid Vulnerability Mitigation with Security Workarounds](https://facsrv.cs.depaul.edu/~zhuang28/RVM-BAR2019.pdf)
    
_       Zhen Huang + Gang Tan
_    
3. [Using Safety Properties to Generate Vulnerability Patches](https://facsrv.cs.depaul.edu/~zhuang28/Senx-Oakland2019.pdf)
    
_       Zhen Huang, David Lie, Gang Tan, + Trent Jaeger
_
5. [The Art, Science, and Engineering of Fuzzing: A Survey](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8863940)
    
_       Manès, Valentin J.M. and Han, HyungSeok and Han, Choongwoo and Cha, Sang Kil and Egele, Manuel and Schwartz, Edward J. and Woo, Maverick
