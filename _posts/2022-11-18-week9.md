TO DO:
- T test between gesture and lexical and vis versa for MICHAEL (is this overall or just Michael?)
- Asymmetry in transition time of signing depending on the order of how things happen
- T-test for MEDIAN not mean
- Look for similarities after the normalization of medians for signing speed
- Signing STYLE = in terms of relative use of lexical and classifiers etc., can say this was an identifier bc we made the hypothesis this was ben, and when we went through this was largely ben. 
- Demographics of signer? Grow up in a deaf household? Look at distribution of number of types of signing. More Deaf you are, the more classifiers you will use. 
    - Boston University - look for info on demographics
- If the signing comes from translations from English, all Lexical. If it is native signing between two people, especially for a story,  more classifiers
- ex: Description + location were in classifiers
- STLAT conference
- Divide by median for standardization (Nicole doing)
- There is a difference in overall signing speed, validated by the p value in stat analysis
