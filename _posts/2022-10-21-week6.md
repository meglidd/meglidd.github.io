title: Week 6
---

At the beginning of week 6, I have switched to a new team and project. I am now working with The American Sign Language Avatar Project at DePaul University with  Professor Rosalee Wolfe and Professor John McDonald. This week was an introduction to the team, of who includes three other DREAM students, in computer science, data science, and animation.

This introduction week included new materials, of which include:
* ELAN software
* Expression Builder Software
* Sign Transcriber Software
* The Lingustics of American Sign Language, a book by Valli + Lucas
* timeBetweenSentence.xlsx
* bigramCategories.py


The project I jumped into, working with Nicole B. and Deannia L., was asking the question, does the function of a sign has an impact of the transition time from that sign?
