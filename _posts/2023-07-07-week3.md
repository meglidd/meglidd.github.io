After using OpenPose of DePaul's server, I was able to use RStudio to pull the x and y coordinates of the key points, specifically, the right and left wrists, to a CSC file. 

Following this, I began creating a Python Colab Notebook via Google to play with the data from the CSB, specifically pulling out the left and right wrist key points, and organizing them in columns so that they can be easily plotted with Python. 

In this first attempt to plot the key points with Python, I plotted all of the 20 key points of the hands, thinking this was what I needed. This was incorrect and not what was needed, and while it was in the correct vicinity, it created many overlapping data points from the many hand points and frames.
