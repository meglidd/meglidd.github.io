I have now received the data from DGS-Korpus at the University of Hamburg. There is a lot of data here that I need to review to see how I can properly search for videos that start in the neutral position.
As the neutral position is actually the null string for the location notation, I plan to search for entries without a HamNoSys location symbol.

Here are the columns in the file that I am working with:

Columns of DGS-Korpus:
A      HamNoSys token format
B      HamNoSys character format which is an encoding of the manual activity for a sign
C      ID
D      All the glosses for those types
E      if available, the ID of a tag showing a studio recording of the type
F      parser output

The ultimate goal is to visualize the distribution of locations that are classified as "neutral".   
To identify these signs is not straightforward, but we can start by creating a very conservative set that is guaranteed to  >> begin << in neutral space and expand the set, as our tools become more refined.
