I begin by writing a Python script to pull the relevant videos from the Excel file.

As I was not able to use the actual HamNoSys symbols to search through the file with Excel, I decided to look at Column E, the parser output, to see if those signs that started in the neutral position had the word "location" in the parser output.
Example:
{"start": [{"lexicalentry": [{"sign2:Sign2isaSign1": [{"sign1": [{"sign1withActions": [{"initialConfig1": [{"posture1": [{"handshape1": [{"handshape1d": [{"handshape1s": ["hamfinger2"]}]}]},{"orientation1": [{"extendedFingerDirection1": [{"extendedFingerDirection1d": [{"extendedFingerDirection1s": [{"extendedFingerDirection1ss": ["hamextfingeruo"]}]}]}]},{"palmOrientation1": [{"palmOrientation1d": [{"palmOrientation1s": ["hampalml"]}]}]}]}]}]},{"actions1": [{"targetedAction1repeated:SingleTargetedAction1repeated": [{"targetedAction1free": ["hamparbegin",{"action1repeatedMult": [{"action1repeated": [{"targetableMovement": [{"simpleMovement": [{"straightMovement": [{"movementArrow": ["hammoved"]}]}]}]}]},{"action1repeated": [{"action1anchored": [{"replacementAction1": ["hamreplace",{"replacement1": [{"extendedFingerDirection1": [{"extendedFingerDirection1d": [{"extendedFingerDirection1s": [{"extendedFingerDirection1ss": ["hamextfingero"]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},"hamparend"]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}

As those videos that began in neutral with no location symbol did not have the word "location" in its output, this is how I went about writing my Python script.

The file: dgs_extract.py: this removes entries from the Excel file that contain the word “location”.

Success! Next week: download the files as batch processing with Python.
